  <h5>There are 4 Technology which we have:</h5>
  <p><b>MRI-</b></p>
  <p>MAGNETOM Verio</p>
  <ul>
    <li>MAGNETOM Verio with Tim+Dot is a proven performer. Demonstrating the power of 3T clinical imaging</li>
    <li>Proven openness –</li>
    <li>Increase patient comfort by the combination of 173 cm ultra-short system length with 70 cm Open Bore</li>
    <li>Expanding care to a wider range of patients (e.g. claustrophobic or obese patients) and Broadening clinical possibilities (e.g. interventional MRI or kinematic studies)</li>
    <li>TimTX True Form – advanced technology High, image quality Faster speed, Excellent clinical performance</li>
    <li>Proven performer
      MAGNETOM Verio with Tim+Dot proves the combination of exceptional image quality and patient comfort. It features a comprehensive application portfolio, reaching from routine to dedicated exams.In each clinical field, syngo® MR applications, powered by Tim+Dot, are helping to create the future of MRI. MAGNETOM Verio offers a high level of flexibility with innovative applications for each body part. And with Tim you can seamlessly scan up to 205 cm with no patient repositioning or coil changes for true whole-body functionality.</li>

  <p><b>CT SCAN-</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>With the SOMATOM Definition Flash, establish industry standards – from scanning without beta-blockers and without hazardous sedation, to characterizing lesions while maintaining dose neutrality with Dual Source Dual Energy.</li>
    <li>Redefining standards in Cardiology–
      CT Scanner - SOMATOM Definition Flash - Redefining standards in Cardiology. When performing a cardiac scan, the main challenge is often posed by the time and effort it takes to prepare the patient. With a scan time of only 0,6 s and a full temporal resolution of 75 ms, the new SOMATOM Definition Flash allows scanning the entire heart and evaluating its morphology and coronaries without any beta blockers. Patients suffering from irregular heart rates or atrial fibrillations benefit from high-end cardiac scanning only taking 250 ms to perform – about a quarter of a heartbeat</li>
      <li>Redefining standards in Pediatrics
        A key challenge in pediatrics is to get these young patients to hold still. Thats why todays standard procedure includes intense preparation, sedation, and after-care.
        The Flash Spiral scan mode combines a scan speed 458mm/s and a temporal resolution of 75 ms – reducing the average examination time to only 0.49 s, in effect allowing you to routinely perform pediatric scans without hazardous sedation. Flash speed and FAST CARE technology make pediatric imaging both easier to use and more patient-friendly </li>
        <li>With Dual Source Dual Energy scanning – the only modality that enables DE scanning at doses comparable to a conventional 120 kV scan –, you will be able to get all the information you need in a single scan. Creating virtual non-contrast images based on the Dual Energy information will help you and your institution save time and resources. Dual Energy Optimum Contrast achieves images with very low noise at high contrasts.</li>

  </ul>
  <p><b>Mammograpghy</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>MAMMOMAT® 3000 Nova combines screening and diagnostics in one unit. The ability to integrate with a variety of CR readers makes it easy to upgrade to digital. A radiation shield with control panel allows operating the system from a protected area. </li>
    <li>The LOGIQ S7 - with XDclear easily handles it, delivering the high quality images, ease of use, and specialized capabilities that busy clinicians need. Well-suited for shared services, the systems versatility can be extended with a wide range of clinical packages, including B-Flowâ„¢, Elastography, Vascular Quantification, B-Steer+, Volume Imaging, and Multi-Modality Imaging Display. Among the new tools available on LOGIQ S7 with XDclear. </li>


  </ul>
  <p><b>Bone densitometry</b>-LUNAR PRODIGY</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lunar Prodigy efficiently provides you with accurate bone mineral density (BMD) and other body composition analyses. Prodigys advanced features not only help your DXA scanning process flow with ease, but they also help enable you to manage your patient data and business more effectively.</li>
    <li>When compared to other manufacturers of DXA devices, GE Lunar DXA densitometers perform scans at a lower dose1, while still achieving higher precision2. A comparison of the technical specifications shows that Hologic** bone densitometers utilize 4 to 25 times radiation of the Prodigy* Advance.</li>
